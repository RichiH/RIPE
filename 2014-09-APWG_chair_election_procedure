The RIPE Address Policy Working Group should attempt to maintain two
Chairpersons whenever possible. Once per year one of the chairs will
offer to stand down to allow new candidates to become chair. This will be
announced by sending an email to the working group mailing list at least
two weeks before the start of a RIPE meeting. Anybody is allowed to
volunteers for the chair position, including the chair who offered to
stand down. At the next RIPE meeting those present at the working group
session will determine by consensus who will take the available chair
position. If no consensus can be reached in the working group session
then the current chairs will stay to ensure the continued stability of
the working group.

Those who volunteer to chair the RIPE Address Policy Working Group should
be aware of the responsibilities and work this involves. A generic
description of the responsibilities of a RIPE working group chair can be
found in RIPE-542 (http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-542). Address policy
working group chairs are also expected to coordinate with the RIPE NCC
Registration Services department on issues and/or questions arising in the
either the working group or the RIPE NCC regarding address policy.
