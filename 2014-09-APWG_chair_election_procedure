The RIPE Address Policy Working Group should attempt to maintain two
Chairpersons whenever possible with two being the maximum. Once per year one of the chairs will
be open for re-election in alternating order.
In case both chairs become vacant at the same time, the RIPE NCC should appoint two temporary Chairpersons.
Open chairs and re-elections will be filled at the earliest oppurtunity. Both normal and extraordinary re-elections will be
announced by sending an email to the working group mailing list at least
two weeks before the start of the relevant RIPE meeting. Anybody is allowed to
volunteers for the chair position, including the Chairperson up for re-election.
At the next RIPE meeting those present at the working group
session will determine by consensus who will take the available chair
position. If no consensus can be reached in the working group session
then the current chairs will stay to ensure the continued stability of
the working group.

Those who volunteer to chair the RIPE Address Policy Working Group should
be aware of the responsibilities and work this involves. A generic
description of the responsibilities of a RIPE working group chair can be
found in RIPE-542 (http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-542). Address policy
working group chairs are also expected to coordinate with the RIPE NCC
Registration Services department on issues and/or questions arising in the
either the working group or the RIPE NCC regarding address policy.
